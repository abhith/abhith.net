Dapper is my preferred ORM for performance constraint applications. It is one of the best solution in case of a database first approach as well as when there is already a database in place. Dapper works with SQL Server as well as so many other DB's and I have tried Oracle DB apart from SQL Server.

Dapper have so many features/extension methods, the documentation of these features can be accessed here.

:point_right: [Dapper Dapper Tutorial | Dapper Tutorial and Documentation ](https://dapper-tutorial.net).

To execute multiple stored procedures or multiple **SQL** statements, we can use the `QueryMultipleAsync` extension method.
See the sample code below,

```cs
using Dapper;
...

public async Task<SomeClass> GetAsync(Guid someId, Guid anotherId)
{
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_settings.ConnectionString()))
    {
        connection.Open();

        const string sql = @"exec uspTableOneAction @someId;
                             exec uspTableTwoAnotherAction @anotherId;";

        using (var multi = await connection.QueryMultipleAsync(sql, new { someId, anotherId }))
        {
            var firstTableItem = multi.Read<TableOneItem>().First();
            var secondTableItem = multi.Read<TableTwoItem>().FirstOrDefault();
           ...
        }

        ...
    }
}
```

In the above code, my stored procedure are,

- uspTableOneAction
- uspTableTwoAnotherAction

The naming convention which we follows for stored procedures are,

```
usp{TableName}{Action}
```

eg: uspUserInsert, uspUserUpdate

And in the above example, first stored procedure expects a parameter `@someId`.
And the second stored procedure expects `@anotherId`. We passed these args by

```cs
new { someId, anotherId }
```

The same can be written as,

```cs
new { someId = someId, anotherId = anotherId }
```

Why we omitted the right hand side part in the example is because of the arguments name matching the parameter.

Just in case if both stored procedures expecting same parameter, say `@someId`. Then our args will look like,

```cs
new { someId }
```

That's it. You have the result of the two queries.
