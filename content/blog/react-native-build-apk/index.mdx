#### First

> react-native bundle --dev false --platform android --entry-file index.js --bundle-output ./android/app/build/intermediates/assets/debug/index.android.bundle --assets-dest ./android/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/debug

#### Second

> cd android

#### Final

> ./gradlew assembleDebug

Once all three commands executed successfully. You can find the generated APK on

> Project root directory > android > app > build > outputs > apk > app-debug.apk

As the name suggests, this is not a release version. But still, you can share it with testers. I use [hockeyapp](http://hockeyapp.net) to do the distribution.
