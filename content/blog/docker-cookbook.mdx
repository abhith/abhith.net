This article is my own reference for Docker development, contains solutions for problems I have faced while working with **Docker** and some helpful external resources.

## Problems

### 1. docker: “build” requires 1 argument. See 'docker build --help'

Most probably you missed a dot, need to add it, example

```bash
docker build -t docusaurus-doc .
```

It means you use the Dockerfile in the local directory

### 2. “read-only file system” error running Docker Toolbox in Windows 7

Try restarting the docker machine by following below steps:

First, you need to find the name of your docker machine

```bash
 docker-machine ls
```

Then with your machine name, run the command

```bash
docker-machine restart <name>
```

### 3. Docker for windows - Mapping docker to localhost

You can do it by configuring your Virtualbox. Follow below steps,

- VirtualBox -> Your BOX -> Settings -> Network ->
- Choose NAT
- Open Advanced
- Click Port Forwarding
- Add a new rule to map the desired port you need from host to guest
- Ok/Save
- Stop Box
- Start the Box

### 4. COPY failed: CreateFile

In my visual studio solution, containing a .NET Core Console app, I enabled Docker support using [Visual studio container tools on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/overview?view=vs-2019).

![ Visual studio container tools on Windows](/img/docker-cookbook-add-docker-support-menu.png)

And it generated a **Dockerfile** inside the selected project but when i tried to build an image from inside the project directory using the docker command

```bash
docker build -t myimagename .
```

It failed with following exception,

> COPY ["ProjectDirectory/ProjectName.csproj", "ProjectDirectory/"]
> COPY failed: CreateFile \\?\C:\ProgramData\Docker\tmp\docker-builder366701720\ProjectDirectory\ProjectName.csproj: The system cannot find the path specified.

This was because I tried to run this from inside the `ProjectDirectory`. Why I tried to run from there was because the while enabling docker support via **Visual Studio 2019** context menu, the Dockerfile generated inside that project directory, not in the root directory of solution.

So inorder to fix this, I moved the same Dockerfile to the root directory of the solution. It can be done via Powershell command

```bash
mv Dockerfile ../Dockerfile
```

Then `cd` into the root directory of the solution where now the Dockerfile is, and run the build command, and it worked.

### 5. Force Docker for a clean build (not using cache)

Using `--no-cache` in your build command.

eg

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t myimagename .
```

### 6. Rename a Container

Using the docker `rename` command.

```bash
docker rename CONTAINER_ID my_new_container_name
```

### 7. \$'\r': command not found

This is occurred when I tried to run some `sh` file in my linux container. That `sh` file was saved in **CRLF** end of line sequence, changing it to **LF** solved the problem.

If you wonder what is **End of line sequence**,

> The End of Line (EOL) sequence ( 0x0D 0x0A , \r\n ) is actually two ASCII characters, a combination of the CR and LF characters. It moves the cursor both down to the next line and to the beginning of that line.

If you are using **Vscode**, switching **EOL** is easy, on the bottom right corner, you can find the current EOL sequence of the editing file, by clicking on it, Vscode will present you a dropdown to choose from. Select the **LF** in this case, and save file.

### 8. Copy docker image from one host another

By using `docker save` command, we can export docker image as a `.tar` file.

```bash
docker save -o /path/image_name.tar image_name
```

The above will create an image_name.tar file in the path specified. Copy it to the new host, then you can import the image to the new host by using `docker load` like below,

```bash
docker load -i <path to image tar file>
```

### 9. Dotnet core build error when building docker image - Missing Newtonsoft.Json

In my case, When used `JsonProperty` in a class,

Visual Studio intellicode auto-filled,

```cs
using Newtonsoft.Json;
```

Then during `docker build`,

> warning MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly "Newtonsoft.Json". Check to make sure the assembly exists on disk.

When I checked, found out that the Visual Studio added an **Assembly Reference** to `Newtonsoft.Json` (you can find this by expanding **Dependencies** node in the solution explorer in Visual Studio). And I was using Linux images.

So in order to solve this, I removed the **Assembly Reference**, and added nuget package `Newtonsoft.Json`, then the `docker build` was successful.

## Questions

### 1. Difference between docker `run` and `start`

In short,

- run : runs an image. i.e it will create a container from that image first and then starts the container. All in one command.
- start : starts the specified container.

So if you created a container from an image using the `create` command, then you can use `start` command to start that container. Or you can start a container from the image by using the `run` command.

### 2. How to change the default docker image name using VS2019

By adding `<DockerfileTag/>` to project property group like given below,

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
    ...
    <DockerDefaultTargetOS>Linux</DockerDefaultTargetOS>
    <DockerfileTag>custom.image.name.here</DockerfileTag>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

## CLI

### docker-compose

#### Build the images, do not start the containers

```bash
docker-compose build
```

#### Build the images if the images do not exist and start the containers

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Force `docker-compose` to build from scratch, no cache

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

#### Force to build the images even when not needed

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Run multiple containers of the same image

```bash
docker-compose up --scale <SERVICE_NAME>=n
```

Replace the `<SERVICE_NAME>` with the appropriate service listed in the **docker-compose.yml** and `n` with the number of containers you want, in order to create that number of containers of that service.

#### Build single container using docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose build <SERVICE_NAME>
```

Replace the `<SERVICE_NAME>` with the appropriate service listed in the **docker-compose.yml**.
