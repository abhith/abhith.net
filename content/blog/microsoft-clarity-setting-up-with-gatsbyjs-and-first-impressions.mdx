I'm impressed. From a long-term **Google Analytics** user point, **Clarity** provides more info about the actual user interactions on the website.

Getting started was pretty easy.

- Sign-up [here](https://clarity.microsoft.com/), it's **FREE**.
- Create a Clarity project for your website.
- Integrate with your website.

There are already some direct integrations available. In my case, I have opted for the `Install tracking code manually`.

## Integrating Microsoft Clarity with GatsbyJS website

### Official plugin

**Step 1**
Navigate to the root of your Gatsby project.

**Step 2**
Open your preferred command line and run one of the following commands.

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-clarity
```

or

```bash
yarn add gatsby-plugin-clarity
```

**Step 3**
Navigate to gatsby-config.js.

**Step 4**
Add the following to your plugins array

```js
{
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-clarity`,
    options: {
      // String value for your clarity project ID
      clarity_project_id: YOUR-CLARITY-PROJECT-ID,
      // Boolean value for enabling clarity while developing
      // true will enable clarity tracking code on both development and production environments
      // false will enable clarity tracking code on production environment only
      enable_on_dev_env: true
    },
}
```

The Clarity tracking code is now installed.

### Legacy way of installing [DEPRECATED]

It is very similar to adding **Google AdSense** as described in my older post here,

:point_right: [GatsbyJS - Add Google AdSense](https://www.abhith.net/blog/gatsbyjs-add-google-adsense/)

All you have to do is, update your `gatsby-ssr.js` with the below code (if there is no `gatsby-ssr.js` file on your project directory then create one at the root).

```js
import React from "react";

export const onRenderBody = ({ setHeadComponents, setPostBodyComponents }) => {
  const pluginOptions = {
    head: true,
  };
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== `production`) {
    return null;
  }

  const setComponents = pluginOptions.head
    ? setHeadComponents
    : setPostBodyComponents;
  return setComponents([
    <script
      async
      type="text/javascript"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: `
      (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
        c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
        t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
        y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
    })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "<YOUR-CLARITY-PROJECT-ID>");
      `,
      }}
    />,
  ]);
};
```

Replace `<YOUR-CLARITY-PROJECT-ID>` with your **Clarity** project ID.
The embedded script you can view at `Clarity Project > Settings > Setup > Install tracking code manually`.

**onRenderBody** is a Gatsby SSR API, called after every page Gatsby server renders while building HTML so you can set head and body components to be rendered in your html.js.

:point_right: [SSR APIs | GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/#onRenderBody)

Build the project (`gatsby build`) and see whether the AdSense snippet is present in the build output HTML (`gatsby serve`).
You can also refer to the same used in my repo itself.

Once you have done the integrations and if the site is live, after a few minutes you will start seeing the metrics getting populated in the **Clarity Dashboard**.

## Dashboard

It is pretty clean and minimal. And it looks like,

![Dashboard](../../static/img/blog/microsoft-clarity-setting-up-with-gatsbyjs-and-first-impressions/dashboard.png)

## Recordings

It's a dope feature. Exactly what each user did, like actual screencast of user interactions on that page with clicks and all. There is a sound indication for mouse clicks as well, Nice.

![Recordings](../../static/img/blog/microsoft-clarity-setting-up-with-gatsbyjs-and-first-impressions/recordings.gif)

It will help website managers to understand how the user is interacting with each element/section on the web page.

Also, sensitive data masking and other privacy concern are taken care of by **Clarity** automatically.

## Heatmaps

As the name suggests, most interacted areas will be visualized here.

![Heatmaps](../../static/img/blog/microsoft-clarity-setting-up-with-gatsbyjs-and-first-impressions/click-heatmap.png)

If you are concerned about the data it collects, privacy, etc, one fact is that it is an opensource project. So you can have a look at it,

:point_right: [GitHub-microsoft/clarity](https://github.com/microsoft/clarity)

I'm impressed with **Microsoft Clarity**. It's not(yet) a replacement for **Google Analytics**, but I would recommend you to try it out and see how you can make use of it.
