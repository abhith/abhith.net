Most of the solution implementations mentioned below can be found in my repo [https://github.com/Abhith/piggy-flutter](https://github.com/Abhith/piggy-flutter).

### Navigation

#### Move to a new screen without back

An example of this use case is the login page. When a user successfully logged in, we redirect the user to another page, and in most case, we don't want a back button to go back to the login page. This can be easily done using **Navigator.pushReplacement**

```dart
    Navigator.pushReplacement(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => HomePage()),
    );
```

### State Management

#### Bloc

As a rookie in the flutter, one of the biggest challenges I faced was state management. Started with StatefulWidget's setState, but sooner understood that it is not enough (state persistence was the tough part). After a long search, found that there are many ways to do it in flutter including Redux, Scoped Model, BLoC etc. I don't like Redux too much, I tried it for React Native app earlier and moved to **mobx-state-tree** instead.

One I got excited about was Streams and BLoC (business logic components). But first found tutorials was not enough and heavily confusing (for a rookie). But tried them one by one and my solutions get better after each commit.

Now in my view, the best way to do it is by using the [bloc package](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/) and the best part of it is, this one is very well [documented](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) with example applications. It also has an extension for VSCODE to ease the usage.

### Build

#### Build failed - null value in entry: outputFile=null

Recently my machine shutdown unexpectedly during a build in progress. After that, all the build is failing with this error.

> Removing the .gradle directory in the root project directory will fix the problem.

#### Error importing package:http/http.dart

After long time, when I tried to build, I got this error. To resolve,

Go to your **pubspec.yaml** file , and add the `http` dependency:

```yml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.2
  http: any
```

Then run the following,

```bash
flutter packages get
```

If you are using **VS Code** as the IDE, the above will be automatically executed once you save the **pubspec.yaml** file. (If you installed the [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) extension for VS Code).

#### SocketException: OS Error: Connection refused, errno = 111 when trying to connect to localhost

My ASPNET Core API's where running on localhost and I was trying to request against the same using the Android emulator, then your server endpoint should be **10.0.2.2:<PORT_NUMBER>** instead of **localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>** as AVD uses 10.0.2.2 as an alias to your host loopback interface (i.e) localhost.

#### More than one file was found with OS independent path 'META-INF/proguard/androidx-annotations.pro'

Adding following in the `android > app > build.gradle` fixed the build error,

```java
android {
     packagingOptions {
         exclude 'META-INF/proguard/androidx-annotations.pro'
     }
 }
```

#### Disable Null Safety Check

Include a version prior to 2.12 in the `pubspec.yaml` file to disable null safety.

```yml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.11.0 <3.0.0"
```
