## Build Pipeline

In this pipeline, we will build the docusaurus website and publish the artifact so that we can use that in the Release pipeline.
And the azure-pipelines.yml for the pipeline given below.

```yml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - master
  paths:
    include:
      - src/path/to/docusaurus/*

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

steps:
  - script: |
      yarn
    displayName: "install dependencies"
    workingDirectory: "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/src/path/to/docusaurus/"

  - script: |
      yarn build
    displayName: "docusaurus build"
    workingDirectory: "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/src/path/to/docusaurus/"

  - task: CopyFiles@2
    inputs:
      sourceFolder: "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/src/path/to/docusaurus/build/"
      contents: "**"
      targetFolder: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
      cleanTargetFolder: true
    displayName: "copy built site"

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    displayName: "Upload Artifacts"
    inputs:
      PathtoPublish: "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)"
      ArtifactName: "docusaurus"
```

In the above, the path to docusaurus website on my repo is `src/path/to/docusaurus`. We are having a monorepo which contains source code for many of the related services, that's why we specified the correct path in each step.

Each step in the build pipeline is self explanatory. Once you run the pipeline, it may look like,
