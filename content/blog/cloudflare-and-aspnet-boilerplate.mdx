I am an early adopter of [aspnetboilerplate][1]. I learned **AngularJS** as part of developing [aspnetboilerplate][1] project and it all started by reading an awesome blog post [Introduction to ASP.NET Boilerplate](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/768664/Introduction-to-ASP-NET-Boilerplate) by **Halil ibrahim Kalkan**. Since then I always recommended using the paid [aspnetzero](https://aspnetzero.com/) template for all the major projects in my workplace. And I used the free [aspnetboilerplate][1] template for some of the projects including my side project, [piggyvault](https://github.com/piggyvault/piggyvault), a family finance management app, and its APIs is built on [aspnetboilerplate](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate).

Similarly, I use [Cloudflare][2] for most of the hosted websites as a firewall-cum-CDN. Recently after hosting the [aspnetboilerplate][1] project on [SmarterASP.net](https://www.SmarterASP.NET/index?r=100571651), I started to face a login issue where it was working fine on local (as always 😆). The traffic to the PROD app was routed via [Cloudflare][2].

Later the troubleshooting journey ended up [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170986-How-does-Cloudflare-handle-HTTP-Request-headers-).

> Cloudflare strips any header that contains dots (.) from origin web server responses. For example, the origin web server header test.header:data is removed by Cloudflare’s proxy.

By default, ABP uses `Abp.TenantId` header as the `TenantIdResolveKey`, and **Cloudflare** strips it resulting in null value always. Thankfully, [aspnetboilerplate][1] provides an option to change the `TenantIdResolveKey`. To change,

In the `CoreModule`,

```cs
// Enable this line to create a multi-tenant application.
Configuration.MultiTenancy.IsEnabled = PiggyvaultConsts.MultiTenancyEnabled;
Configuration.MultiTenancy.TenantIdResolveKey = "Piggy-TenantId"; // your key without "."
```

It resolved the login issue.
