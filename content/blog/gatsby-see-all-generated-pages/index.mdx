If you want to see the list of pages generated by Gatsby, you can use the GraphiQL playground part of the Gatsby Dev (usually served on [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)).

Run the below query and you will be presented with the list of pages,

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  allSitePage {
    edges {
      node {
        path
      }
    }
  }
}
```
