If you have a static website like a portfolio without a contact form then you are missing so many opportunities.
I realized it after adding a contact form on my website here.

Now you might be thinking about how difficult it is to add a form to your website, and I can tell you that it is easier than you think. Without any backend codes, we can consume some of the awesome **FORM BACKEND as a Service** providers. Some of them I explored yet are listed here.

## Services

<Alert kind="important">

### Getform

> Form backend platform for designers
> and developers

My current [contact form](/contact/) is powered by [Getform][1]. Their free plan details given below,

![Getform pricing](../../static/img/blog/best-free-form-provider-for-static-websites/Getform-pricing.png)

~~It indicates 100 Submissions in the FREE plan which I thought renews every month but the FAQ says it's not.
That triggered me to search for another provider who offers a better FREE plan.~~

The pricing model of [Getform][1] changed and I am happy with the change.

If you want to check how I created the contact form in this Gatsby website using **[Getform][1]**, check my commit [here](https://github.com/abhith/abhith.net/commit/ad46ca37cfd5bc76593aff0ca11a75156d1b77fb)

### Kwes forms

It looks like [Kwes][2] offers more features and a generous 50 submissions per month for FREE.

### formsubmit

If you want unlimited submissions for FREE, **[Formsubmit][4]** is the one.

> Formsubmit sends all your form submissions to your email without having a need for any coding or a backbend. SignUp (optional) to get additional advantages.

And they don't even have a pricing page to show ðŸ’™
