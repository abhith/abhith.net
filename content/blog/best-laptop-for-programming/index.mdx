For the past month, I have been in the search for the best laptop, that will help me to do things faster. **Best in the sense which worth every penny and yet strong in specs**, not a high-end gaming machine.

### History

Laptops I used earlier are,

- Dell Inspiron (Exact series don't remember)
- HP Pro Book
- Lenovo Y520 (256 SSD)
- Lenovo G40

In the above list, none of them owned by myself, first 3 out of the 4 was given by my ex-company during the employment period and the other is rented out from my brother-in-law. Out of all Lenovo Y520 was my favorite just because of its specs and speed.

### Minimum Requirements

Right now its time to own a machine, and the **minimum** features am looking for are,

1. Thunderbolt 3 support.
2. SSD
3. Intel i7-9750H processor
4. RTX 2060 Graphics card
5. Fingerprint sensor

### Shortlisted Laptops

The main YouTube channels which I rely for laptop reviews are,

- [Dave Lee (Dave 2D)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYamHliCI9rw1tHR1xbkfw)
- [OWNorDisown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkTweJExGMqp3NLvzvOn-yg)
- [Matthew Moniz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVlMUh4WsDQvOxCJJXmWwdw)
- [Jarrod'sTech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Rzju32yQPkQ7oIhmeuLwg)
- [Bob Of All Trades](https://www.youtube.com/user/satanjamez)

And After watching tons of reviews and all, my shortlisted items are,

#### AERO 15

Model Name: WA-7US5130SP
[Official Website](https://store.gigabyte.us/aero-15-oled-wa-7us5130sp-uhd-amoled-i7-9750h-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-gddr6-6gb-16gb-ram-512gb-m-2-pcie-ssd-win-10-pro-gaming-laptop/)

On the pro side, it ticks all my requirement 5/5.

##### Cons

- Web Camera position
- Thermal throttling

##### Purchase AERO 15

#### ThinkPad X1 Extreme (2nd Gen) (15.6") Laptop

#### Acer Predator Triton 500

Model Name: PT515-51-73EG
[Official Website](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/predator-model/NH.Q50AA.003)

Watch the reviews,

On the pro side, it matches my requirement 4/5. But on the con side, it is not easily upgradable because of its inverted motherboard construction. See the below video,

Other than that, Only zoned RGB keyboard, **NO** per key RGB.

Couldn't find the exact one in [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2KrpHcz) but similar spec with intel 8750H found [here](https://amzn.to/2KrpHcz).

#### HP Omen 15 (Latest)

Check out the below review.

Its the cheapest in this list. And it got a bit more gaming look.

#### Any Refurbished WORKSTATION

To save some bucks.

### Skipped Laptops

- **Acer Helios 300 (2019)** - Lack of thunderbolt support.
- **Lenovo Y740** - Big Charger and small battery.
- **Asus ROG Zephyrus S GX701** - Lack of thunderbolt support.
- **ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX502GW** - Lack of thunderbolt support.

### Conclusion

And my search ended when I found a good deal on [Dell Precision 7720](https://www.newegg.com/global/ae-en/p/N82E16834844793?Item=N82E16834844793). Even though it only ticked 2 out of my 5 requirements, am pretty satisfied with it.
