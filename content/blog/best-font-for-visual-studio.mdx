Unlike the default user, most programmers do care about the font they are using, so do I.
The most used IDEs in my case are the brothers, Visual Studio, and the Visual Studio Code.
In both, I use the same font which is **Cascadia Code**.

## Cascadia Code

After reading [this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/math-in-office/cascadia-code-font/) article, I switched to `Cascadia Code`.

> The Cascadia Code font is an open-source font developed to improve the readability of program text in plain-text editors such as in the Windows Terminal, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code.

## Previously Used

### JetBrains Mono

Try JetBrains Mono in your IDE. Its simple forms and attention to every detail make coding a nice experience for developers’ eyes, no matter which IDE you choose.
Check out the official website. The website itself is **MARVELLOUS**.

#### VS Code Settings

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, Fira Code",
"editor.fontSize": 13,
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.letterSpacing": 1.2,
```

### Fira Code

Monospaced font with programming ligatures.

All the instructions to install the font and configuring it in the IDE's including **Visual Studio** and **Visual Studio Code** is documented in the wiki.

### Fantasque Sans Mono

Fantasque Sans Mono is my choice for the past two years. You need to try it to see how good it is.

> A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

#### How to install the new font (windows)

- Download the font from [here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest)
- In the ttf folder, double-click each font file, click “Install font”; to install all at once, select all files, right-click, and choose “Install”.
- Open Visual Studio settings. **Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors** > Choose **Fantasque Sans Mono** from the font
  list > OK.
