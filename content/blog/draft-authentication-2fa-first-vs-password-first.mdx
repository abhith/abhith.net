User will notified only if account gets locked                                                                                                                            | User will get SMS always and can reach a state where he cannot use his mobile due to the continuous attack resulting very bad user experience                                                     |
| Chance for user account gets locked (if account lock enabled for failed login attempts) | Possible if number of failed login attempts exceeds the threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Low                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Chance for password compromise (slow brute force)                                       | Possible since password can be guessed (000000 to 999999) but login will fail since after password validated, they have to complete SMS verification.General rule is, If I get a 2FA notification that I did not expect, it's time to change my password. | Low chance for password compromise but annoying SMS notification which user cannot disable                                                                                                        |

| Password Complexity                                                                     | By increasing complexity, we can prevent the brute force                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not applicable                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Account Lookup                                                                          | Very low: since incase of wrong username/password. We are showing a generic message "incorrect username of password" so attacker may not able to find if the user registered in the system                                                                | HIGH: We are forced to say incase a user entered a wrong mobile number (which not registered in the system), if we didn't notify the user, there are chance for them to wait for OTP indefinitely |

So the attacker can force the user to pay huge cell phone bills                                                                            |
