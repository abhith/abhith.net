A bit late to review 2021 work-life but "better late than never", right?

In 2021, my focus was on mainly **[Cloud Native](/topics/cloud-native/)** solutions. And one of my favorites of last year is, **[Dapr][2]**.

Other interesting findings of last year are,

- [Backstage][1]
- [CloudEvents][3]
- [Tye][4]

And the list goes on.

Let's talk about work for now.

## More Azure

I'm an [Azure][5] guy. Interacting with it almost every working day.
My 2021 facts related to Azure are,

- Started using more [Azure Logic Apps](/topics/azure-logic-apps/)
- Used [Azure Cosmos DB](/topics/cosmos-db/) the first time - it is our event store now.
- Integrated Azure maps
- Used [Azure Cognitive Search](/topics/azure-cognitive-search/)
- Baby steps with Azure Synapse + Power BI
- Azure app configuration + Feature flags - Advocating colleagues to use feature flags.
- Release annotation in [Azure Application Insights](/topics/app-insights/) - Want to make it part of CD, TODO for 2022.
- Started switching to Azure Managed Identity
- Played with [ML Studio](/topics/machine-learning/)

## Rest of the work

Some of the other notable things I was doing last year are,

- Introduced geofence-based solutions - Hoo, the left-hand rule.
- Migrated to [JIRA](/topics/jira/) cloud and set up some easy JIRA automation.
- Now everywhere [CloudEvents][3] - I like that spec.
- Done [CI/CD][7] setup for Java, [Angular](/topics/angular/) projects other than [.NET][6].
- More into [Event-driven](/topics/event-sourcing/) architectures.

And yeah, we switched to **Postman** cloud.
The Postman is a good tool but for a [microservice](/topics/microservices/) guy like me, the tabs are not enough.

## Pure Work

During this period, I have introduced around 12 RFCs in my workplace out of that 9 got landed in the production already.
Rest are on the way. If you wonder what is an RFC, it is where we propose a new feature (major) to be developed, and the way it should be developed, some more deep dives into technical plus user stories on the same.

And I closed almost 263 JIRA work items during the same period.

A major role that I handled last year is to team up with a **Java** resource where I managed the work.
Even though I am not a **Java** guy, I was reviewing the PRs (even corrected some, 😁).
And it went really well, together we delivered _7_ java microservice _components_.

> The `components` term came to me from [Backstage][1]

Regarding **PR**s, previously I was following **Gitflow**, now switched to **GitHub flow**.
And for release, **Release Flow** as recommended by [Microsoft VSTS Team](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/release-flow-how-we-do-branching-on-the-vsts-team/).

When I switch any of my workflow or tools, I always recommend my colleagues to follow the same by pointing out the benefits.
My interest in [Backstage][1] is because I care about developer experience too.
Always looking for great ways to organize work, improve the workflows.

## Plans for 2022

- Even though I'm working mostly on the Azure, never went for a certification. This year, I will.
- After delivering several components (stable, reliable, and feature-rich) successfully by just **managing** the work, I realized that way I can contribute more to the work. Feels like time to go up a level, let's see.
- Code migration from [Azure DevOps][7] to [GitHub](/topics/github/): Advocating team about the benefits of **GitHub** over **Azure DevOps** for code.

Wish me a good year 😊
