In our company, all the projects source code is under source control, which is **Visual Studio Online** (VSO). And most of them are using **GIT** as the **version control** (VSO supports Git as well as TFS).

Last year I initiated to follow **Git Flow** method as the branching model for the new projects and it's going well. Colleagues are getting used to it.

Recently when I created a feature branch in the VSO online interface, I checked the Visual Studio **manage branches** window in the **Team Explorer** to checkout the new branch but couldn't find it there under **Remote Branch**. The refresh button on the top of Team Explorer had no effect on the branches.

### Workaround

Until visual studio provides a better solution, you can use the **SYNC** option in the **Team Explorer**, which will also fetch the new branch list.

#### Useful
