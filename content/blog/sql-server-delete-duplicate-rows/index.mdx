Deleting rows from a **SQL Server** table is no big deal. But it becomes a little complicated when we are in a situation like a table with no primary keys or unique column and it has duplicate records which we need to delete.

When tried to delete rows using the context menu in the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**, it failed with an error message indicating the action affects multiple records.
But if you try **Azure Data Studio** to do the same, it will delete all the similar rows, not just the one you choose to delete.

So, in this case, we can use a query like below,

```sql
 WITH CTE AS(
   SELECT [Col1]
      ,[Col2]
      ,...
      ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY [Col1] ORDER BY [Col1]) AS RN
   FROM [dbo].[Table]
)
SELECT * FROM CTE
```

In the above query, we are using a CTE to list the data along with an additional column _RN_ which will have a value higher than 1 for the duplicate entries.

> It is always a good idea to "SELECT" and double-check the data before doing a hard "DELETE"

So first run the above query and inspect the rows with `RN>1`,
Once you are okay with the results, execute the delete.

```sql
 WITH CTE AS(
   SELECT [Col1]
      ,[Col2]
      ,...
      ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY [Col1] ORDER BY [Col1]) AS RN
   FROM [dbo].[Table]
)
DELETE FROM CTE WHERE RN > 1
```
