Code first, talks later

```js
$(".class-name").removeClass("class-name");
```

In the above code, we are finding all the elements that do have the class and removing it.

### Story behind this post

Today my colleague asked me whether they can remove some specific class from whole elements who do have the class. Not just that, this has to be done only on mobile devices (post about **Determine if the user is on the mobile device** is coming next). This post is to make his day a little easier.

#### Update

The post [Determine if the user is on the mobile device](https://www.abhith.net/post/javascript-determine-if-user-is-on-mobile-device/) is live now.
