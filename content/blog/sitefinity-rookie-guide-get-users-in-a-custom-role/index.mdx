I am pretty new to **Sitefinity** and started learning since one of the upcoming projects is need to be done in the Sitefinity.

Now spent few days in a POC, in which one requirement is to list users in a custom role that we created. And it can be achieved easily using below code,

```cs
var roleMngr = RoleManager.GetManager("Default");
var usersInCustomRole = roleMngr.GetUsersInRole("CustomRole");
foreach (var user in usersInCustomRole)
{
    var userProfileManager = UserProfileManager.GetManager();
    var sitefinityProfile = userProfileManager.GetUserProfile<SitefinityProfile>(user);

    ...
}
```

Replace the **CustomRole** with the role name which you have created, in my case, it was **Reviewer**. Since we want users in a custom role (i.e role which we created), we need to use the **Default** provider.

> The custom roles you created are part of the Default Provider.

In case of built-in roles, use **AppRoles** as the provider name to get the role manager.
