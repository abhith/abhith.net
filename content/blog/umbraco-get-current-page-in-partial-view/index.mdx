In my website, the header section is a partial view which basically contains the header menus. The menus initially were same for all the pages across my site but I thought to hide some menu in case the current page is not the homepage.

To do that, I needed to get the current page and check whether the current page is the homepage or not, in the header partial.

To get the current page in partial view,

```cs
@inherits UmbracoTemplatePage

@{
    var currentPage = Umbraco.Content(umbraco.NodeFactory.Node.GetCurrent().Id);
}
```

And to check whether it is home page or not, I decided to compare against DocumentTypeAlias as shown below,

```cs
@if (currentPage.DocumentTypeAlias == "home")
{
     // some code
```

And it works.
