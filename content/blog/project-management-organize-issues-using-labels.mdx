  Here I am listing the labels which I used to organize my tasks in almost all the project management solutions like Jira, Gitlab and GitHub.
tags:
  - project-management
  - github
  - gitlab
  - jira
  - style-guide

Labels are a good way to categorize the tasks. But having too many in an unorganized way results more clutter.
Here is my way of labeling issues/tasks. This is the way I organize my tasks in **GitHub**, **GitLab** and in **Jira**.

### Area

Indicating the area to which issues belong.

| Label                                           | Description       | Color     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| <Badge fill="#8bd9e5">area/optimization</Badge> | Fine tuning works | `#8bd9e5` |
| area/security                                   |                   |           |
| <Badge fill="#ccbef7">area/ux</Badge>           | User experience   | `#ccbef7` |

### Priority

Used to prioritize the issues.

| Label                                                        | Description                          | Color     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| <Badge fill="#d93f0b" textColorIsWhite>priority/high</Badge> | Requires immediate attention         | `#d93f0b` |
| priority/medium                                              | Requires attention soon              |           |
| priority/low                                                 | Does not require immediate attention |           |

### Stage

Indicating the current stage of the issue.

| Label                                                                 | Description                                                         | Color     |

**Stage** labels like _in progress, backlog_ etc can be skipped in **GitHub** if you linked the issue to a project which has relevant columns matching these stages.
