Labels are a good way to categorize the tasks. But having too many in an unorganized way results more clutter.
Here is my way of labeling issues/tasks. This is the way I organize my tasks in **GitHub**, **GitLab** and in **Jira**.

### Area

Indicating the area to which issues belong.

| Label               | Description       | Color |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| area: optimization  | Fine tuning works |       |
| area: documentation |                   |       |
| area: security      |                   |       |

### Priority

Used to prioritize the issues.

| Label            | Description                          | Color |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| priority: high   | Requires immediate attention         |       |
| priority: medium | Requires attention soon              |       |
| priority: low    | Does not require immediate attention |       |

### Stage

Indicating the current stage of the issue.

| Label                      | Description                                                         | Color   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| stage: investigating       | Someone is looking into this                                        |         |
| stage: wontfix             | Does not regard this as an issue or will not implement this feature |         |
| stage: backlog             | Prioritized to be picked up in current sprint                       |         |

| stage: awaiting response   | Potential fix was proposed; awaiting response                       |         |
| stage: pending release     | Works associated with this issue is done but not deployed           |         |
| stage: ready for work      | The issue is reproducible and in scope                              |         |
| stage: needs information   | Not enough info to reproduce the issue                              |         |
| stage: needs review        | Work done but needs review                                          |         |
| stage: needs investigating | Someone needs to look at this                                       |         |
| stage: work in progress    | Someone is working on it                                            | #68db1c |
