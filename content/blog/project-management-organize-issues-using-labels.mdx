  Here I am listing the labels which I used to organize my tasks in almost all the project management solutions like Jira, Gitlab and GitHub.
tags:

import Badge from "../../src/components/badge";

Labels are a good way to categorize the tasks. But having too many in an unorganized way results more clutter.
Here is my way of labeling issues/tasks. This is the way I organize my tasks in **GitHub**, **GitLab** and in **Jira**.

### Area

Indicating the area to which issues belong.

| Label                                      | Description       | Color     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| <Badge fill="#8bd9e5">optimization</Badge> | Fine tuning works | `#8bd9e5` |
| security                                   |                   |           |
| <Badge fill="#ccbef7">ux</Badge>           | User experience   | `#ccbef7` |

### Priority

Used to prioritize the issues.

| Label                                             | Description                          | Color     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| <Badge fill="#d93f0b" textColorIsWhite>P0</Badge> | Requires immediate attention         | `#d93f0b` |
| P1                                                | Requires attention soon              |           |
| P2                                                | Does not require immediate attention |           |
| <Badge fill="#f5f5f5">P3</Badge>                  | Low priority items                   | `f5f5f5`  |

Previously I was using,

| Label                                                        | Description                          | Color     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| <Badge fill="#d93f0b" textColorIsWhite>priority/high</Badge> | Requires immediate attention         | `#d93f0b` |
| priority/medium                                              | Requires attention soon              |           |
| priority/low                                                 | Does not require immediate attention |           |

### Stage

Indicating the current stage of the issue.

**Stage** labels like _in progress, backlog_ etc can be skipped in **GitHub** if you linked the issue to a project which has relevant columns matching these stages.
