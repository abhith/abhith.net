On rare occasions, you may want to remove all local and remote git tags from your repository. For that, you can follow the below [Recommended Steps][1].

In short, first, we are replacing the local tags with the remote tags, then removing all remote tags with reference to the local tags, and finally, removing all local tags.

## Recommended Steps

### 1. Delete all local tags

```bash
git tag -d $(git tag -l)
```

### 2. Fetch all remote tags

```bash
git fetch
```

Retrieves all remote tags giving you a complete list of remote tags.

### 3. Delete All remote tags

```bash
git push origin --delete $(git tag -l)
```

Deletes the remote tags with reference to the local list.

### 4. Delete All local tags

```bash
git tag -d $(git tag -l)
```

Once again, deletes all local tags.

## Unnecessary Details

One of the rare occasions to delete all tags in my case was, that we were maintaining a monorepo in Azure DevOps, and wanted to migrate it to GitHub, but in a **repo per component** manner. So,

- First I did import the monorepo by following :point_right: [Code Migration From Azure DevOps to GitHub](https://www.abhith.net/blog/github-vs-azure-devops-for-code/#code-migration-from-azure-devops-to-github),
- Then removed all other component's code from the repo (git history is still dirty with other component's old commits)
- Re-configured the existing Azure pipeline triggers, i.e switched to a tag-based trigger. So, on each new release in GitHub, the connected Azure pipelines will run.

Now, the monorepo had so many tags including the tags of the other components. So, I wanted to remove all the tags from the repo before proceeding with the GitHub releases, and I did use the [Recommended Steps][1] above.
