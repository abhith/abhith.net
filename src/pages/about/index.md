I'm Abhith Rajan, a [Software Engineer](https://github.com/abhith) from India.
I work for the Product Team at [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/). At the moment my desk is located in **DIFC Dubai**, the leading financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region.

My role involves prototyping, and developing backend as well as front end apps with modern workflows, and frameworks.
Keeping an eye on the patterns and organized code. And deploy them to [Azure](/topics/azure/) using [Azure DevOps](/topics/azure-devops/) pipelines and monitor everything running in there.
For the backend apps including [Microservices](/topics/microservices/) am a .NET guy.
For the front-end apps, I have choices (Angular, React, Vue, Razor Pages and more), and my pick varies from project to project.

I blog about programming, code, technology, and stuff that I'm interested in.
