I'm Abhith Rajan, a [Software Engineer](https://github.com/abhith) from India.
I work for the Product Team at [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/). At the moment my desk is located in **DIFC Dubai**, the leading financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region.

My role involves prototyping, and developing backend as well as front end apps with modern workflows, and frameworks.
Keeping an eye on the patterns and organized code. And deploy them to [Azure](/topics/azure/) using [Azure DevOps](/topics/azure-devops/) pipelines and monitor everything running in there.
For the backend apps including [Microservices](/topics/microservices/) am a .NET guy.
For the front-end apps, I have choices (Angular, React, Vue, Razor Pages and more), and my pick varies from project to project.

I blog about programming, code, technology, and stuff that I'm interested in.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abhithrajan), [GitHub](https://github.com/Abhith), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/abhith), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhith/). If you want to email me, go ahead and send an email to [abhith@pm.me](mailto:abhith@pm.me).

## BACKGROUND

I started my career at [Aabasoft](http://aabasoft.com) where I joined as an intern after my B-Tech education and worked there for over 3 years as a Software Engineer and then moved to [Sysberries](http://sysberries.com) where I spend another almost 3 years, then in [Unibeton Ready Mix](http://www.unibetonrm.com/en-gl/home). In 2019, I joined [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/) where I work now.

## INFORMATION OVERFLOW

I love racing, a big fan of **Valentino Rossi**. The first thing I bought after I got my first job was my **Yamaha R15 V2** bike. And I got a cool number for that bike, KL 40J **201**. After I moved to the UAE, the one thing that hurt me most is, that **I MISS MY BIKE**.
