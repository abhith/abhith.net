## How much I donated

By looking at the [Piggy](https://github.com/piggyvault/piggyvault) reports,

<div class="columns">
<div className="column is-half">

| Year | Amount (INR) |
| ---- | ------------ |
| 2021 | ~34,000      |
| 2020 | ~75,000      |
| 2019 | ~20,000      |
| 2018 | ~34,000      |
| 2017 | ~38,000      |
| 2016 | ~35,000      |

</div>
<div className="column">

- The only reason I found for the shrinkage in the donation budget during 2018-19 is that I got married üíô.
- The tilde (~) indicates that the amount is almost equal since multiple currencies are involved
