### Fantasque Sans Mono
Fantasque Sans Mono is my choice for the past two years. You need to try it to see how good it is. 

> A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

It is also opensource and you can find it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans).  (3k+ stars).

#### How to install new font (windows)

 - Download the font from
   [here](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans/releases/latest)
 - Open Fonts directory in windows. (Search for "font" in windows and you will see it as the first option)
 - Open the downloaded zip file, drag and drop the items in the **OTF** directory to the Fonts.
 - Open Visual Studio settings. **Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors** > Choose **Fantasque Sans Mono** from the font
   list > OK.

If you have a better suggestion, let me know in the comments.
