You may think why such a post in 2018. This is because I recently moved to another firm where I have to support some legacy apps.

Few of them are built using **Visual Studio 2010** and they have no plan to upgrade so far. After working so long in VS2017 with ReSharper and all, working with VS2010 is not so pleasant. But in order to improve the default experience VS2010 offering, following extensions helped me so far.

- [I Hate #Regions](#i-hate-regions)
- [devColor](#devColor)
- [Brace Completer](#brace-completer)
- [Highlight all occurrences of selected word](#highlight-all-occurrences-of-selected-word)
- [Go To Definition](#go-to-definition)
- [Productivity Power Tools](#productivity-power-tools)
- [AllMargins 2012](#allmargins-2012)
- [DPack](#dPack)
