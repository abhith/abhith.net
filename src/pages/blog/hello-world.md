Hi! Welcome to my very first blog :)

First of all, a little bit about myself. For the last five years or so I have been developing websites for others so recently thought of why don't build one for myself?

Now here I am.

Here I wish to share my knowledge, experience and more. All the content will be my own and the images published will be either I made, like the one in this post (it is my visual studio), or will be from [unsplash][1].

This is a work in progress website so you may notice some broken parts but I will fix em as per my free time.
